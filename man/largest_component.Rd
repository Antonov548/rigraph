\title{Find the largest connected component of a graph}
\usage{
largest_component(graph, mode = c("weak", "strong"))
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The original graph.}

\item{mode}{Passed to \code{components()}. Ignored if \code{graph} is undirected.}
}
\value{
The largest connected component of the graph.
}
\description{
This function returns the largest connected component of a graph. In case of
a tie, the first component by vertex ID order is returned. Vertex IDs from
the original graph are not retained in the returned graph.
}
\examples{
g <- sample_gnp(8, .2, directed = TRUE)
V(g)$color <- 1:N
plot(g)
plot(largest_component(g))
plot(largest_component(g, mode = "strong"))
