\title{Decide if two graphs are identical}
\usage{
identical_graphs(g1, g2)
}
\arguments{
\item{g1, g2}{The two graphs}
}
\value{
Logical scalar
}
\description{
Two graphs are considered identical by this function if and only if
they are represented in exactly the same way in the internal R
representationi. This means that the two graphs must have the same
list of vertices and edges, in exactly the same order, with same directness
and identical graph, vertex and edge attributes.
}
\details{
This is similar to \code{identical} in the \code{base} package,
but it ignores the mutable piece of igraph objects; those might be
different even if the two graphs are identical.
