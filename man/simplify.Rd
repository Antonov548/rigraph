\usage{
simplify(
  graph,
  remove.multiple = TRUE,
  remove.loops = TRUE,
  edge.attr.comb = igraph_opt("edge.attr.comb")
)

is_simple(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The graph to work on.}

\item{remove.multiple}{Logical, whether the multiple edges are to be
removed.}

\item{remove.loops}{Logical, whether the loop edges are to be removed.}

\item{edge.attr.comb}{Specifies what to do with edge attributes, if
\code{remove.multiple=TRUE}. In this case many edges might be mapped to a
single one in the new graph, and their attributes are combined. Please see
\code{\link{attribute.combination}} for details on this.}
}
\value{
For \code{simplify}, a new graph object with the edges deleted. For
\code{simplify_and_colorize}, a named vector with three items: \sQuote{res}
contains the simplified graph, \sQuote{vertex_color} contains the vertex
colors and \sQuote{edge_color} contains the edge colors.
}
\description{
Simple graphs are graphs which do not contain loop and multiple edges.
}
\details{
A loop edge is an edge for which the two endpoints are the same
vertex. Two edges are multiple edges if they have exactly the same two
endpoints (for directed graphs order does matter). A graph is simple is
it does not contain loop edges and multiple edges.

\code{is_simple} checks whether a graph is simple.

\code{simplify} removes the loop and/or multiple edges from a graph.  If
both \code{remove.loops} and \code{remove.multiple} are \code{TRUE} the
function returns a simple graph.

\code{simplify_and_colorize} constructs a new, simple graph from a graph and
also returns two additional "color" vectors, one for the vertices and one for
the edges. The colors of the vertices represent the number of self-loops that
were originally incident on them, while the colors of the edges represent the
multiplicities of the same edges in the original graph. This allows one to
take into account the edge multiplicities and the number of loop edges in
the VF2 isomorphism algorithm.
